# 🧠 3D Mesh Normalization, Quantization, and Error Analysis

This project implements a **3D mesh data preprocessing pipeline** for the **SeamGPT Data Processing Assignment**. It covers the full workflow — from loading mesh data to normalization, quantization, reconstruction, and error analysis — and includes a **bonus adaptive quantization** task for rotation and translation invariance.
